Comedian (Banana) by Cattlan

-  The Art Basel booth of Peerotin gallery a day before the closing of the fair because it had caused ‘several uncontrollable crowd movements.’
- how we assign worth and what kind of objects we value

- “‘Comedian,’ with its simple composition, ultimately offered a complex reflection of ourselves on how we assign worth and what kind of objects we value.
-- Don’t ask if the duct-tape banana is art. Ask if it’s any good.
-- Cattelan has turned the act, the truly absurd event, of rich people buying bananas and the ensuing media spectacle into a kind of performance art. Or yes (ha!), a new kind of stand-up.
-- It’s not the banana, in other words, that constitutes the art. It’s the grotesqueness of the sale and ensuing spectacle, and more specifically, it’s the idea that the system is absurd. The work, in other words, is in sympathy with your feelings about it!
